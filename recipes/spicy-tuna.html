    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Tuna poke is a traditional Hawaiian dish made with fresh, cubed raw tuna that’s lightly seasoned and served over rice or greens. The fish is typically marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar, which enhances its natural flavor without overpowering it. Chopped green onions, sesame seeds, and seaweed are often added for texture and depth. Some variations include ingredients like avocado, cucumber, or mango for a touch of sweetness and freshness. The dish is cool, refreshing, and full of umami, making it both satisfying and healthy. Tuna poke captures the essence of island cuisine—simple, fresh, and bursting with flavor.</p>

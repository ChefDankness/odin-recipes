    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Chicken katsu curry is a beloved Japanese comfort dish that perfectly balances texture and flavor. It starts with a tender chicken breast that’s coated in panko breadcrumbs and deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. The chicken is then sliced and served alongside a bed of fluffy steamed rice. What makes the dish truly special is the Japanese curry sauce—thick, smooth, and mildly spiced with notes of turmeric, cumin, and a touch of sweetness. The curry is often poured generously over the chicken and rice, creating a warm, hearty meal that’s both satisfying and comforting. Some versions include vegetables like carrots, onions, and potatoes simmered in the curry for extra depth. The contrast between the crunchy chicken and the silky, savory sauce makes every bite deliciously indulgent. Often garnished with pickled radish or a sprinkle of green onions, chicken katsu curry offers a perfect blend of Japanese flavor and homestyle comfort.</p>
